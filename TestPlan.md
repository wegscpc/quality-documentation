<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for our retail banking application. It serves as the primary reference for all testing activities throughout the project lifecycle.

### 1.1 Goals of the Master Test Plan

The primary goal of this Master Test Plan is to outline a comprehensive and structured approach to the testing of the retail banking application, to determine if the application meets all the business and technical requirements. This plan serves as a guide to align testing activities with the overall project objectives, aiming to achieve the following:

- **Validate Quality**: Validate that the retail banking application performs as expected across multiple channels, including online platforms, physical branches, ATMs, and in-person interactions.

- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify and address potential risks and defects early in our software development lifecycle to prevent post-release issues.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Test that the application conforms to the banking regulations and security standards, such as PCI-DSS and GDPR as applicable, in order to protect the customer data and maintain transactions' integrity.

### 1.2 Summary of the Test Strategy

The test strategy for the retail banking application is a multi-pronged test approach:

- **Test Levels**: Testing will be conducted at the test levels, including Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT). In each test level, the focus will be different, in order to gauge application quality from different points of view.

- **Types of Testing**: The types of testing will include functional testing for core banking operations, performance testing to assess system scalability, security testing to test safety of the sensitive data, and usability testing to test the customer experience.

- **Test Automation Strategy**: Test automation will be used to increase repeatability and efficiency. Automated tests scripts will be developed for smoke testing, high-priority functional test scenarios and regression testing.

- **Defect Management**: A systematic defect management process will be followed to track and resolve issues. This includes categorizing defects by severity, prioritizing them based on impact, regular tracking for their timely resolution and retesting on resolution.

- **Test Environment and Data Strategy**: A controlled and consistent test environment will be established to replicate the production environment (as closely as feasible). Test data will be stored securely in a centralized repository, with anonymized and representative data sets available for test execution.

### 1.3 Purpose of the Document

This document serves as a detailed guide for the testing of the retail banking application. It provides a structured template, that is reusable in similar projects. It aims to:

- **Provide Clarity**: Give a clear understanding of the testing objectives, scope, and strategies to all stakeholders, including the client, project managers, business analysts, developers, and testers.

- **Increase Coordination**: Establish a common testing methodology and test approach to coordinate efforts within the testing team, and with the developers and other stakeholders.

- **Create Consistency**: Create a consistent test approach that can be adapted for future projects, encouraging the reuse of test assets and alignment with organizational testing standards.

- **Support Decision-Making**: Serve as a reference for decision-making throughout the software testing lifecycle, providing guidelines regarding test process management (for example managing the test progress, risk areas, and quality metrics).

## 3. Requirements Strategy
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

### 3.1 Requirements Gathering Approach

The requirements gathering process will involve multiple stakeholders, such as business, product owners, development team, and the testing team. The process will follow these steps:

- **Stakeholder meetings**: Conduct workshops with business stakeholders to capture functional and non-functional requirements, including use cases (including specific scenarios related to online banking, ATM interactions, and in-branch processes) and user stories.

- **Document Analysis**: Review existing Business Requirement Documents (BRDs), Functional Specification Documents (FSDs), and regulatory compliance guidelines to identify detailed requirements and constraints that the application must satisfy.

- **Prototyping and User Feedback**: Create mockups or prototypes of key application features to gather initial feedback from end-users and other stakeholders.

- **Change Management**: There will be a process for managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle. All changes must be reviewed, the impact on the testing scope and schedule must be evaluated and the changes agreed by all relevant stakeholders.

### 3.2 Requirements Prioritization

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Critical (Must-Have) | Essential for the core functioning of the banking application, such as transaction processing, account management, and security compliance |
| High (Should-Have) | Enhance the user experience or operational efficiency but are not critical for initial deployment, such as advanced reporting features and non-essential third-party integrations |
| Medium (Could-Have) | Provide value but are not crucial to the core application functionality |
| Low (Won't-Have for Now) | Can be deferred to future releases without impacting the overall application integrity or user experience |

### 3.3 Testing Traceability

As outlined in the 2.2 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) section above, a comprehensive Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) will be used to map each requirement to corresponding test cases:

- **Traceability Links**: Each requirement will be uniquely identified and linked to specific test cases across test levels (unit, integration, system, and UAT).

- **Bidirectional Traceability**: The RTM will support bidirectional traceability, allowing for the identification of which test cases validate each requirement and vice versa.

- **Coverage Analysis**: It will be performed to identify any gaps in the testing process. This will involve reviewing the RTM to confirm that all high-priority requirements, as defined in the prioritization section, are covered by corresponding test cases.

- **Compliance and Audit Readiness**: The RTM will be maintained as a living document throughout the project lifecycle and will be used to demonstrate compliance with regulatory and business requirements during audits or project reviews.

### Requirements Coverage
| Requirement Type | Testing Approach | Priority |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| Functional | End-to-End Testing | High |
| Security | Penetration Testing | Critical |
| Performance | Load Testing | High |
| Usability | User Acceptance | Medium |

  - Each environment mirrors specific aspects of production
  - Configured based on testing types (functional, performance, security)

- **Configuration Management**:
  - Version-controlled environment configurations
  - Documented server settings, database connections, network configurations
  - Formal change management process for configuration changes

- **Test Data Management**:
  - Test data strategies applied across environments
  - Compliance with privacy regulations
  - Use of anonymized or synthetic data where required

#### Environment Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - Implementation of Nagios/Splunk for environment health monitoring
  - Server performance, database integrity, and network status tracking
  - Automated alerts for deviations and potential issues

- **Regular Maintenance**:
  - Scheduled database refreshes
  - System patches and hardware upgrades
  - Off-peak hour maintenance windows

- **Environment Access Management**:
