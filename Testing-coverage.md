### 1.1 What is Test Coverage? 🤔

Test coverage is a metric that measures how much of your software is tested. It helps determine whether your test cases adequately cover the application code and functionality.

#### Key Aspects:

- **📊 Measurement**: 
  - Percentage of code executed
  - Requirements covered
  - Scenarios tested

- **🎯 Objectives**: 
  - Identify untested code
  - Ensure comprehensive testing
  - Improve test quality

### 1.2 Why is Test Coverage Important? 💡

#### Benefits:

| Aspect | Benefit | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Quality** ✨ | Better defect detection | Finding edge cases |
| **Confidence** 🛡️ | Reliable releases | Validated functionality |
| **Efficiency** ⚡ | Optimized testing | Focused test efforts |
| **Maintenance** 🔧 | Easier updates | Impact analysis |

### 2.1 Types of Coverage 📚

#### 2.1.1 Code Coverage 💻

- **Statement Coverage**
  - Measures executed code lines
  - Basic coverage metric
  - Easy to understand and implement

- **Branch Coverage**
  - Tests decision points
  - Covers all possible paths
  - More thorough than statement coverage

#### 2.1.2 Functional Coverage 🎯

- **Requirements Coverage**
  - Maps tests to requirements
  - Ensures feature completeness
  - Validates business logic

- **Risk Coverage**
  - Focuses on critical areas
  - Prioritizes high-risk features
  - Risk-based testing approach

## Chapter 3: Coverage Techniques ⚙️
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

### 3.1 Statement Coverage 📝

#### Characteristics:
- Tests each line of code
- Basic coverage metric
- Foundation for other techniques

#### Implementation:
```python
def example_function(x):
    if x > 0:           # Statement 1
        return True     # Statement 2
    return False        # Statement 3
```

### 3.2 Branch Coverage 🌿

#### Characteristics:
- Tests all decision paths
- More thorough than statement coverage
- Includes conditional logic

#### Example:
```python
def complex_function(a, b):
    if a > 0:          # Branch 1
        if b > 0:      # Branch 2
            return "A"  # Branch 3
        return "B"      # Branch 4
    return "C"          # Branch 5
```

### 3.3 Path Coverage 🛣️

#### Characteristics:
- Tests all possible paths
- Most comprehensive
- Resource-intensive

### 3.4 Condition Coverage 🔄

#### Characteristics:
- Tests boolean conditions
- Covers multiple conditions
- Detailed logical testing

## Chapter 4: Coverage Metrics 📊
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

### 4.1 Measuring Coverage

#### 4.1.1 Code Coverage Metrics
```
Coverage % = (Covered Items / Total Items) × 100
```

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Statement | Lines Executed / Total Lines | 80-90% |
| Branch | Branches Covered / Total Branches | 70-80% |
| Path | Paths Tested / Total Paths | 60-70% |

#### 4.1.2 Functional Coverage Metrics

- **Requirements Coverage**
  - Tested Requirements / Total Requirements
  - Priority-based coverage
  - Risk-weighted metrics

- **Feature Coverage**
  - Tested Features / Total Features
  - User story coverage
  - Acceptance criteria coverage
